# genetic-genealogy

## Data Science techniques applied to human DNA data

Using G25 coordinates for both ancestral and modern DNA samples publicly available from scientific research

Global 25 coordinates from: <https://vahaduo.github.io/g25download/>

(Originally from Eurogenes â€” see <https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2019/07/getting-most-out-of-global25_12.html>)

Datasets manually filtered by epoch / age (Bronze, Iron, etc)

Additional data comes from

- David Reich's Lab at Harvard (<https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml>)
- Indo-European.eu (https://indo-european.eu/ancient-dna/)
- YFull's ancient DNA samples (<https://www.yfull.com/ancient/>)

R code using Jupyter notebooks includes

- Principal Component Analysis
- Hierarchical Clustering
- K-means Clustering
- Nearest Neighbors
- Graph Analysis
- XGBoost
